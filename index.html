            <p>
                Before coming to the definition, let's see three distinct but related ideas about vector.
                Let's start with Physics and then understand in Mathematics and Computers Science
            </p>

            <div>
                <b>In Physics:</b>
                Vector's are arrows pointing in space. What defines a given vector is, it's length and
                the direction it points to. Vector that live in flat plane are 2D, the line you see from the origin:
                <div style="display: flex; width: 100%; justify-content: center;">
                    <img src="images/2d-vector.png" height="250" width="250" />
                </div>
                and sitting in broader space that you and I live are 3D vectors.
                Point (x, y, z) is vector in 3D space from origin
                <div style="display: flex; width: 100%; justify-content: center;">
                    <img src="images/3d-vector.png" height="250" width="250" />
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>
                <b>In Mathematics:</b>
                Vector's can be anything where there's a sensible notion of adding two vectors
                and multiplying a vector by a number
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Vectos in Machine Learning:</b>
            <p style="font-size:10px">
                <i><b>Note:</b>
                    Down the line in tutorial, we will discover linear algebra vectors for machine
                    learning in detail.

            <ul>
                <li> Vectors are effective way to store objects and object collection. </li>
                <li>
                    Vector's are used to represent attributes of entities like: age, name, sex and scores etc. and this
                    can be anything.
                </li>
                <li> Vectors can be form of data itself, model parameters and so on. </li>


                <li> Vectors are often represented using a lowercase character such as "v"; for example:
                    <p> v = [
                        v1,
                        v2,
                        v3
                        ]
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>
