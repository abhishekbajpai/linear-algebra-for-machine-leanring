                Before coming to the definition, let's see three distinct but related ideas about vector.
                Let's start with Physics and then understand in Mathematics and Computers Science
            </div>

            <div class="mt-3">
                <b>In Physics:</b>
                Vectors are arrows pointing in space. What defines a given vector is, it's length and
                the direction it points to. Vector that live in flat plane are 2D, the line you see from the origin:
                <div class="vector-img">
                    <img src="images/2d-vector.png" height="250" width="250" />
                </div>
                and sitting in broader space that you and I live are 3D vectors.
                Point (x, y, z) is vector in 3D space from origin
                <div class="vector-img">
                    <img src="images/3d-vector.png" height="250" width="250" />
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="mt-3">
                <b>In Mathematics:</b>
                Vectors can be anything where there's a sensible notion of adding two vectors
                and multiplying a vector by a number
            </div>

                <p class="ft-size-10">
                    <i><b>Note:</b>
                        Down the line in tutorial, we will discover linear algebra vectors for machine
                        learning in detail.

                    <li> Vectors are effective way to store objects and object collection. </li>
                    <li>
                        Vectors are used to represent attributes of entities like: age, name, sex and scores etc. and
                        this
                        can be anything.
                    </li>
                    <li> Vectors can be form of data itself, model parameters and so on. </li>
                    <li> Vectors are often represented using a lowercase character such as "v"; for example:
                        <p> v = [
                            v1,
                            v2,
                            v3
                            ]
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
